### About Marketing Mix Modeling
Marketing Mix Modeling, also known as MMM or simply Mix Modeling, is a statistical analysis method that helps businesses assess the impact of various marketing inputs (such as advertising, promotions, pricing, and distribution) on sales or other business outcomes. By understanding the individual contributions of different marketing channels, MMM enables marketers to make informed decisions about resource allocation and maximize return on marketing investments.
